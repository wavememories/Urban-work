## Urban Work Github Repo

### Intro
Urban Work is a project to showcase an ongoing series of visual provocations with the intent of inspiring conversation about the forces that influence urban fabric and the way humans live. It's inspired by the works and thoughts of urbanists, designers, planners, engineers and all other manner of urban thinkers.

In physics, *work* is done when a force is applied to an object. Urban Work will explore how various forces interact and influence how we live in our communities.
